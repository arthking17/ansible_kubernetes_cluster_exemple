# cluster_kubernetes

Automation of Kubernetes cluster creation ( Im using Ubuntu 16.* as server OS)


## Get started with creation of Kubernetes cluster using Ansible üõ†Ô∏è‚öôÔ∏èüí°

## share ssh-key to all hosts to configure

```
$ ssh-keygen #on all host where you want to connect via ssh
$ ssh-copy-id username@ip-addr #ip-addr of host where you generate ssh key
```

## And you are now able to connect to those hosts, try the command below to test the connection

```
$ ansible -m ping -i inventory all #test the connection
```

## You need to generate encrypt_value for var sudo_password and host_password needed in playbook and inventory file

- [ ] first method by creating encrypting variable and store the encrypt var in your project
```
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string 'sudo_password_val' --ask-vault-pass  --name 'sudo_password'
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string 'host_password_val' --ask-vault-pass  --name 'host_password'
```

- [ ] second method by creating a vault file to store all sensible information
- cmd to create a vault file
```
$ ansible-vault create group_vars/all/vault
```
 - cmd to edit your vault file
```
$ ansible-vault edit group_vars/all/vault
```

## Run a playbook

- [ ] this cmd will ask for vault password use to encrypt encrypt_var used in the playbook
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml --ask-vault-password
```
- [ ] with this cmd you have to create a file ( exple .vault.yml ) who will content your vaul password
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml --vault-id .vault.yml
```
